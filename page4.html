    <p>Unlike every Animal Crossing game before it, in New Horizons your island is a <b>blank slate</b>. There's no store, no tailor shop, no museum, no town hall. The first account made is the account of the island representative, tasked with the good image of the entire island.
    Tom, Timmy, and Tommy live in a tent and Isabelle hasn't been hired yet. You're on your own.</p>

    <p>To start improving your island you'll need to talk to Nook. Ask <i>"What should I do?"</i> and he should tell you about his pal <b>Blathers</b>, the owl who will eventually curate your museum. After Blathers comes to town, Timmy and Tommy will ask you to help them collect
    30 <b>hardwoods, softwoods, woods, iron nuggets, and stones</b>. Two days after you've collected the materials, <b>Nook's Cranny</b> will be in business.</p>
    <p>With the economy sky-rocketing, Tom Nook will ask you to build the town's first <i>bridge</i>. You'll be crafting a bridge construction kit and setting up your bridge to be built the next day.</p>
    <img width="475" height="399" src="Images/animal-crossing-new-horizons-resident-services-upgrade.jpg">
    <p>Now that the town has a bridge, it's time to improve <b>Resident Services</b> for whatever pressing matters a town of anthropomorphic animals might have. In 2 days, Resident Services will be completed, with its new assistant, <b>Isabelle</b>, and Nook will ask another favor of you,
    to set up plots for new island residents. He'll also ask you to craft some furniture for each plot. Next, he'll ask you to select some land for a campsite where potential residents will stay. <b>Finally</b>, when all of this is done and accounted for, you will begin trying to improve
    your island's rating. Visiting Isabelle, you can check on the 5 star rating of your island as a whole. <b>Natural environment, outdoor decoration, and general contentment</b> all make up the island rating.</p>

    <p>The main story line requires you to get your town up from a 1 star rating to a 3 star rating, in order to get <b>K.K. Slider</b>, a canine musician, to do concerts on your island. But how do you do this? There's no one way to decorate your island but here are some tips. The <b>natural
    environment</b> of your island is the flowers, trees, and fruit trees on your island. If you want flowers you can shop at Nook's Cranny. They only sell 2 types of flowers though depending on your island type. If you want exotic flowers you'll have to wait for your weekly visit from
    <b>Leaf</b>, the sloth flower vendor.</p>

    <p>The formation of your island can be altered too. This is called <b>terraforming</b>. The <b>construction permits</b> cost between 2000 to 6000 Nook Miles (see page 2). You can create paths, make rivers, or create cliffs. All of these can help you add to your island's natural environment.</p>
    <p>To decorate your island, try to use standard outdoor furniture peices. At the ABD you can buy these items with your <b>Nook Miles</b> (see page 2). Vending machines, utility poles, public benches, and playground toys can be bought with Nook Miles. You can buy fruniture with bells, too.
    Decorating the outside of your island can really improve your rating. In addition a well decorated island, the citizenry should be happy if your island is decorated well.</p>
