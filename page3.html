    <p>In New Horizons you get to live the way you want, so of course that means decorating as you wish. The game introduces decorating outdoors, but this page is going to focus on your <b>home</b>. There have been so many furniture and items to decorate
    your humble abode in past games and New Horizons offered a whole new variety of decorative pieces. What with DIY Recipes you can make anything from a golden toilet (from experience) to a robot hero!</p>
    <p>In previous games your household would receive a rating for how well it was decorated. Same for New Horizons. Every <i>Sunday</i>, you will receive a letter from the <b>Happy Home Academy</b>, or HHA for short. These letters are a performance review of
    how well your home is decorated. <b>Does your furniture match? Are the walls well decorated? Is there a theme? Are there flowers?</b> and on and on. These questions and their answers contribute to the points your house receives and depending on the size
    of your house, you get a letter grade. The ranking system is:</p>
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li>Need to improve for rank</li>
    <li>B Rank</li>
    <li>A Rank</li>
    <li>and S Rank</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Let's get into how to acquire an <b>S rank</b> house. The first thing you'll need to know about is the space of the house. In the beginning of New Horizons, <b>Tom Nook</b> gives you a tent to set up. Your ulgy yellow tent can only be set up in a fixed
    area of your island, but can be relocated later in the game for <b>50,000</b> bells. <i>Anyway</i>, this tent has a <b>4 by 4</b> area. This part of the game isn't much for decorating your house because it's so small. You won't receive letters in the mail
    from the HHA until you get a real, brick and mortar <i>house</i>.</p>
    <p>How might you get this house? First you have to pay off your moving fees and there are 2 ways to go about it. One you can do it the standard way and pay the raccoon <b>49,800</b> bells. Or you can do it the new way introduced in New Horizons and hand over
    <b>5000 miles</b> (see page 2 for details). Whichever way you do it you'll then have the option to expand your house with a loan of <b>98,000</b> bells. As you might have noticed, New Horizons, like all of the games in the Animal Crossing franchise, runs on
    real time, so when Tom Nook says that your house will be built tomorrow he means sometime in the next <i>24 hours</i>. So wrap up, wait a day, and come back tomorrow for your new house!</p>
    <p>There are 7 stages of your New Horizons home:</p>
  </center>
    <ol>
      <li>One room (6 by 6) = 98,000 bell loan</li>
      <li>One room (8 by 8) = 198,000 bell loan</li>
      <li>One room + back room (6 by 6) = 348,000 bell loan</li>
      <li>Two rooms + left room (6 by 6) = 548,000 bell loan</li>
      <li>Three rooms + right room (6 by 6) = 758,000 bell loan</li>
      <li>Four rooms + second floor (10 by 6) = 1,248,000 bell loan</li>
      <li>Five rooms + basement (10 by 6) = 2,498,000 bell loan</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That's over <b>5 million</b> bells! Make sure to use my list of the <a href="page2.html"><b><u class="special">Best Ways to Get Bells</u></b></a> to pay those down payments fast! Now to fill your house. As I mentioned before, there is a lot of furniture to
    make and buy. Furniture often comes in sets. Sets of furniture are complimentary and earn you lots of points! If you mix sets well enough you can get yourself even more points.</p>
    <img width="600" height="315" src="https://gamewith-en.akamaized.net/article/thumbnail/rectangle/18071.png">
    <p>Matching colors also help a lot. Unlike the old games the items you buy and craft come in many different colors. Using customization kits at a DIY workbench you can change the color of almost any piece of furniture or miscellaneous item.</p>

    <p>The next caterogy is wall-mounted items. Hanging things on the walls of your house can make them feel less empty. Wreaths and records, clocks and maps, try to add a theme to your walls. There are even posters of your island residents available (see more on page 6)!
    Rack up those points and you'll have a high ranking house in no time!!!</p>
