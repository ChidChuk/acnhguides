    <p>The older games had a variety of ways to get <i>rich</i> with the game's monetary currency, <b>Bells</b>. New Horizons doesn't stray far from the previous games on this basis. You have your basic activities:</p>
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li>Selling fruits, materials, and unwanted furniture</li>
    <li>Catching bugs</li>
    <li>Fishing</li>
    <li>and <b>now</b> Diving</li>
  </ul>
  <center>
    <p>Here, I'll list these methods of earning bells in order of least to most effective along with the many new ways introduced in New Horizons.</p>
    <img width="300" height="300" src="https://ih1.redbubble.net/image.1183701900.0865/st,small,507x507-pad,600x600,f8f8f8.jpg"><img width="550" height="300" src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2020/articles/2020-03-10-10-37/animal-crossing-nook-mileage-header.jpg/EG11/resize/1200x-1/animal-crossing-nook-mileage-header.jpg">
    <p>The first and least effective method is selling <b>Nook Miles Tickets</b>. Nook Miles and Nook Miles Tickets are a new system introduced in New Horizons.<b></b>Nook Miles</b> is like a real life mileage program earned through doing activities in the game.
    These miles can then, eventually, be traded in at the ABD for special items and <i>DIY Recipes</i>, another feature introduced in New Horizons.</p>
    <p>A special item that can be purchased with Nook Miles is a Nook Miles ticket. Bringing this to the airport
    lets your take a trip to a, sometimes, deserted island. There are many islands that you can visit with Nook Miles Tickets, each with unique resource and lots of bugs and fish to catch. If you're lucky you might chance upon a specialty island with rare
    features. Nook Miles Tickets sell for <b>10,000</b> bells which in my opinion is a rip-off because the tickets have so much to offer. One trip can haul in <i>10 times</i> that many bells, so think twice before selling that ticket!</p>

    <p>The second least effective bartering method is selling <b>furniture and materials</b>. New Horizons put a new meaning to Do It Yourself by utilizing the materials not collectible in the previous games. <b>Flowers, weeds, softwood, hardwood, wood, bamboo,
    stones, clay, iron, gold, and even fruits</b> can be used to make items, tools, clothes, and any furniture that can't be purchased from the game's raccoons. These materials don't sell for much, with the exception of fruit. They're much more useful in recipes.</p>
    <p><b>Furniture</b> is the same. Whether you popped a balloon, or bought it but didn't end up using it, keep your furniture! New Horizon has a storage feature in your house where you can keep that furniture until you use it. The game has a lot mor places for
    this furniture to go now that you can decorate outside. Popping the goods out of your storage is much more easier than buying them back again for a higher price and waiting a day for them to arrive!!!</p>

    <p>It thought this item deserved its own section because it wasn't as bad as selling materials and furniture, <i>but</i> not as good as selling Bell Vouchers. For this reason <b>selling fruit</b> is the 3th least efficient way to earn bells in New Horizons. Selling fruit isn't
    very good nor bad. They can be used for recipes and they sell for a good amount, in addition to coming back every <b>2</b> days if the tree isn't cut down.</p>

    <p>The 4th most effective way to earn bells is selling <b>Bell Vouchers</b>. These are purchased for <b>500 Nook Miles</b> and are worth <b>3000</b> bells each. This is a way to turn your leftover miles into Bells but <b><u style="color: blue;">CAN'T</u></b> be turned back
    into miles. Collecting Bell Vouchers is tedious, though, seeing as you can only purchase one at a time with a lot of narration in between so get ready to stand at the ABD for a while! <i>Important to Note</i>: Try to refrain from buying vouchers if you're saving up miles!</p>

    <p><b>Catching bugs</b> is the third best way to earn bells in New Horizons. Using your crafting materials you can make 3 types of nets, flimsy, regular, or golden. <u style="color: blue;"><b>Spoiler Alert</b></u>: <b>Golden</b> tools like this net only come after a lot of time
    playing so don't get your hopes up yet. Using a net you can catch any bugs in the air, on trees, or on the ground on your island. There isn't anywhere a bug can't be except for the ocean, of course.</p>
    <p>Bugs, like most things in the game, are seasonal. Some bugs only appear at one time of the year at only one time of day. They aren't unpredictable if you've encountered them before, and there's even an app on your <i>Nook Phone</i> that helps you log all of your bugs. Bugs,
    though, aren't worth as much as most fish or underwater creatures. The rarest of bugs rarely are worth more than 10,000 bells. However, if you want your bugs to sell for more you can wait for <b>Flick</b>, an island visitor and bug collector. Flick comes on random days and purchases
    your bugs for <i>1.5 times</i> the regular price. Save up your rare bugs and <b>BOOM</b>, you're making 10s of 1000s of bells!</p>

    <p>The second most effective method is a tie between <b>Fishing and Diving</b>. Like most Animal Crossing games there's a fishing mechanism. Like with the net, you can craft a fishing rod out of island materials. Then, simply walk up to a shadow in a body of water, cast your
    line, and reel it in!! Fish come in all shapes and sizes and are worth various amounts of money. The most expensive of fish are worth <b>15,000</b> bells! Like with bugs, an island visitor named <b>C.J.</b> will randomly visit your island. After you complete one of his seasport
    challenges he will buy your fish for <i>1.5 times</i> the regular price!</p>
    <p>Diving is tied with fishing because the price of fish and sea creatures is often the same. To dive you need a <b><i>wetsuit</i></b> which you can purchase from the game's famous raccoons. When standing by the ocean you can press <b>A</b> to dive in! There is no island visitor
    for your sea creatures, but once a day, a red otter named <b>Pascal</b> will ask you for a scallop you just caught. In return he'll give you a mermaid DIY recipe or outfit which can't be found anywhere esle.</p>

    <p><i>Finally</i>, the most effective way to earn bells in New Horizons is investing in the <b>Stalk Market</b>. Every Sunday, a boar merchant with a basket of turnips named <b>Daisy Mae</b> will appear on your island from <b>8AM to 12 noon</b> selling those turnips at a different
    price each week. For every day after that <b>Timmy and Tommy Nook</b> will be buying those turnips for a different price each day.</p>
    <p>This system is all about luck and a bit of strategy. You won't want to fill your pockets because turnips can't be stored and if you want them out of your
    pockets you either have to eat them or drop them on the ground at the mercy of Mother Nature. <i><b>VERY Important to Note</b></i>: Be Careful!!! Your turnips will expire the following Sunday and spoiled turnips sell for <b>0</b> bells!</p>
