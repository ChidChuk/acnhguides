    <p>This page will tell you about all of those details not mentioned or showed in the trailers, and not discoverable except if it's a total accident.</p>

    <p>First is the <b>golden spot</b>. Once a day a glowing spot will appear on your island. Digging up the spot gives you <b>1000</b> bells, but what you put back in is what's important. Selecting your pocket change, you can take out a bell bag and bury
    it in the glowing hole. This creates a <b>Money Tree</b>. The tree will grow like any other tree you plant, but when it's finished it will have 3 bell bags on it.</p>
    <p>If you put in 1000 bells, each of the bags will hold 1000 bells. If you put in more than 1000 bells but less than 10,000 there's a chance you'll get 3 btaches of the amount you put in, but there is a greater chance you'll get 3 batches of 1000 bells.
    If you put in 10,000 bells, each of the bags will hold 10,000 bells. If you put in more than 10,000 bells there's a chance you'll get 3 btaches of the amount you put in, but there is a greater chance you'll get 3 batches of 10,000 bells. The largest amount
    of  possible bells is 3 batches of <b>99,000</b> bells.</p>
    <p>This would have made my list of the <a href="page2.html"><b><u class="special">Best Ways to Make Bells</u></b></a> if it wasn't so unreliable.</p>

    <p>Second is not so secret after a while of playing and it is <b>island visitors</b>. Your island has special characters that all serve different purposes.</p>
  </center>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Saharah</b> the camel sells rugs, wallpapers, and floorings once a week.</li>
      <li><b>Leaf</b> the sloth sells flowers and hedges from her stand.</li>
      <li><b>Kicks</b> the skunk, as you can guess, sells shoes as well as backpacks.</li>
      <li><b>K.K. Slider</b> the famous hipster dog, performs concerts every <b>Saturday after 6PM</b> and slips you a CD after the first one of the night.</li>
      <li><b>Daisy Mae</b> the boar sell her turnips at a different price every Sunday (see page 2).</li>
      <li><b>Redd</b> the fox sells authentic <i>(wink wink)</i> paintings out of his boat every two weeks.</li>
      <li><b>Label</b> the porcupine asks you to model a themed outfit every two weeks.</li>
      <li><b>Gulliver</b> the seagull gets stranded on your island shores every two weeks. Speak to him repeatedly to wake him up. He'll ask you to dig up communicator parts, but don't return them to him to get rusted parts the following morning.</li>
      <li><b>C.J.</b> the otter will come every two weeks. He'll buy your fish for 1.5 times the regular price after you do one of his seasport challenges.</li>
      <li><b>Flick</b> the red chameleon comes every two weeks and buys bugs for 1.5 time the regular price.</li>
      <li><b>Celeste</b> the owl appears on meteor shower nights and gives you <b>zodiac and star-themed DIY recipes</b>. More about her on my <a href="page5.html"><b><u class="special">Star Hunting</u></b></a> page.</li>
      <li><b>Wisp</b> the ghost will appear any night after <b>8PM</b>. Talking to him will spook him sending 5 spirit pieces around your island. Using a net you can catch them and return them to him. In return he'll give you <i>Something New or Something
      Expensive</i>.</li>
    </ul>
